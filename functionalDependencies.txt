Functional Dependencies

We write down a cononical basis for the functional dependencies:

User:
username -> firstName, lastName, password

CaseDetail:
caseId -> title, street, city, zipCode, isOpen, date, description, authorUsername

CaseNote:
caseId, caseNoteId -> text, date, authorUsername

Person:
personId -> text, date, authorUsername

PersonNote:
personId, personNoteId -> text, date, authorUsername

Category:
(no nontrivial dependencies)

CategoryForCase:
(no nontrivial dependencies)

Suspected:
(no nontrivial dependencies)

Conviction:
convictionId -> personId, caseId, startDate, endDate

It is apparent from the above description that for each nontrivial dependency a->b the left side a is a superkey of the relation. Hence the model is in BCNF.

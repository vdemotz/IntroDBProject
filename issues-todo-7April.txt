Issues:
-----

Persons of intrest: duplicate Entries (ok)
CaseDetail is probably not in 3rd Normal Form - the street and zipcode probably functionally determine the city (ok)
String literals, constants (kinda ok)
Search by name Semantics (null values) (ok)
How to display null values, where to handle it (in BeanTableHelper?) (ok)

-----
Todo:
-----

Must have:

Add Convicts L
Add Conviction L
Add Categories to Cases V:ok
Testing, Testcases, Error Handling  (V/L)
Reduce use of string literals (V/L)
Consistent naming scheme for static constants (ok)
Fix search by name semantics (V:ok)
Nicely display null values (L:ok)
    -composite fields (location - ok , name - ok) need special care (V,L)

Nice to have:

Link columns with dynamic link names
We could show some Properties (eg. high normal form) for our schema
Other aggregate view of Cases, maybe Persons
    - could show off some advanced grouping queries

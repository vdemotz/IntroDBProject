Issues:
-----

PersonDatastore: no synchronized needed
Persons of intrest: duplicate Entries
CaseDetail is probably not in 3rd Normal Form - the street and zipcode probably functionally determine the city
String literals, constants
Search by name Semantics (null values)
How to display null values, where to handle it (in BeanTableHelper?)

-----
Todo:
-----

Must have:

Add Convicts
Add Conviction
Testing, Testcases, Error Handling
Reduce use of string literals
Consistent naming scheme for static constants
Fix search by name semantics
Nicely display null values
    -composite fields (location, name) need special care

Nice to have:

Link columns with dynamic link names
We could show some Properties (eg. high normal form) for our schema
Other aggregate view of Cases, maybe Persons
    - could show off some advanced grouping queries

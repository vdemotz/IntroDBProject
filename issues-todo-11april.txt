Todo:

* Types of Conviction
* More test data
* New ER
* Functional dependencies (maybe)

Issues 11 April

*CaseCreationServlet: isValidDate: seems rather unnecessarily complicated, and in any case badly named

*CaseDetail: Check null/empty title.


*where to put Category creation

*Advanced stats queries. Ideas:
->users that have recently commented on cases a user created or recently commented
->recent comments by other users on cases that have been recently commented or created by a user
->number of modifications per hour of the day
->Most active categories per user (number of cases a user modified per category)
->List of Cases per Category modified by a User

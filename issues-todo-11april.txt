Todo:

* Types of Conviction
* More test data
* New ER
* Functional dependencies (maybe)

Issues 11 April

*CaseCreationServlet: isValidDate: seems rather unnecessarily complicated, and in any case badly named (renaming : done. change, to discussion : if you have better solution to cast String -> timestamp (with check of the format) , I agree!)

*CaseDetail: Check null/empty title. (done)


*where to put Category creation (Vincent's opinion : don't move. We don't have other overview of categories in other place)

*Advanced stats queries. Ideas:
->users that have recently commented on cases a user created or recently commented
->recent comments by other users on cases that have been recently commented or created by a user
->number of modifications per hour of the day
->Most active categories per user (number of cases a user modified per category)
->List of Cases per Category modified by a User
->most active users
->most active users for a particular category
